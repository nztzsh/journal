here i am staring at a blank canvas after quite a while.
this felling is humbling and confusing. i don't know what to write. it has been such a long time since i last talked to myself.
maybe that's why i feel this brain fog all the time. the irony is that with every key press, the next one is becoming slightly easier.
anyways this is just me writing without any topic, this is supposed to be some sort of a therapy or meditation, perhaps.
if i were to be extremely honest, this is just me sitting with myself and using my brain to write something that's not code or a prompt to an LLM.


anyways there's no need to tell myself about the benefits of writing, i already know that.
in fact, journalling or writing in some form or another has been on my 'to-do' list since (again) quite a while.
there have been so many things on that list. i think it's high time i make the choice -
either start working on items from that backlog or dump some of them. closure one way or the other.

i have been accumulating a wide variety of these to-dos and most of them have not made it past the thinking/ideating phase.
thanks to ai and newly acquired 'adult money', i have ample of ways to procrastinate. always been a procrastinator.
before starting anything, i keep on researching ways to pursue the thing in the most optimal way possible, buying the right set of tools i need.
thought it, bought it but still at zero day, something's missing for sure. probably something to do with me, no points for guessing.

as i'm thinking about what it could be, i am noticing that in this act, in this very moment, i am working on an item from the list.
i am journalling! finally! it feels good. writing does feel good and this is no discovery, but a rediscovery. 
i am liking the sound and feel of my mechanical keyboard while typing. but there's something more that pleases not my ears or eyes but the thing between them.
maybe it's just inertia that we need to come over? because i just noticed that i have written a bunch of words and sometime back i was confusingly looking at the abyss.

now that the topic has become about the backlog of aspirations, why not think about another item from the list?
one of the latest additions was about me starting a youtube channel. this is not the first, second, third time i've thought about that.
but as my whatsapp status reads - "fall seven times, rise eight". i think it's time to do something about it.

i have been learing about 3d modelling using blender and very recently watched a few tutorials on davinci resolve and video editing.
i thought i will make gameplay videos but have been struggling with ideas. what can i create which has some novelty.
i think the fact that i have created the video would be novel enough xD
jokes apart, how to solve the creativity problem? 
but wait, isn't it the same problem i faced as i sat to write something just a while ago?
staring at the blank canvas, looking straight into the abyss.
but i solved it atleast for the writing part, didn't i?
maybe i just need to start and give it a try.
instead of half ass thinking about video ideas while i am actually doing something else, why not just sit down on my workstation and take it from there?
that's what i am gonna do next.

anyways, i think that's enough writing for today. i think i will continue this.
it is helping me clear my brain fog and this feels like the right kind of dopamine one should be having.
so i will continue these casual, therapeutic, self reflective writing sessions. 
i might as well have an idea to give it a bit more structure.

i can think of this exercise as finding my axioms for life. the core established truths i can build my reasoning upon following first principles.
the tools i can use to navigate life better.
and as with any other human, i do have a set of guiding principles - some in my conscious brain, others in subconscious.
this exercise would be to reflect on, formalise and refine those principles and harden them into tools for life.

with that, closing vim today on a high note. cheers! to axioms for life!
