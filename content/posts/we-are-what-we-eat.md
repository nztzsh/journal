a few days ago i finished reading "the war of art" by steven pressfield. 
i was reading it to get some ideas on how to be creative.
the book is divided into three parts.
the third part talks about the idea how someone does not create art but art gets created 'through' them.
steven explains it with muses and how they bless the artist to convey what they want to convey. 
the idea of muse here is an entity which is not exactly in our control but if we keep showing up daily with good intent and put in the work -
she might bless us on a fine day or night and we might be beethoven composing our symphonies.

this idea of muse has a supernatural flavour to it. that flavour gives a sense of awe.
the kind of flavour that keeps you curious, excited and humble.
then a thought occurred - how are LLMs so creative?
we always thought creative jobs will be the last to be replaced by AI if at all.
then open AI released chat GPT and rest is history in making.
so why do gods bless LLMs on a daily basis? how come GPT is able to write on whatever topic and in whatever style?
what is its muse? is it just some 0s and 1s and weights of its neural net nodes?
sure, but i think the answer lies in what concept they represent.

LLMs broadly have two types of memories - the short term contextual memory and the long term memory.
contextual memory is like a chat session and what all context you give to the model.
the long term memory is those neural net weights which formed due to its training.
since the training set is so humongous, it kinda knows everything at the back of its head.

if i were to draw analogies - contextual memory is more like our conscious mind.
the working set of information in my head when i'm replying to an email while brushing my teeth.
the long term memory is like our subconscious mind that dictates the often unnoticed patterns of my brush strokes on my teeth.

our subconscious is our long term memory, accumulation of our lifetime experiences, our muse, might as well our gateway to god.

-----------

thinking it from that view puts us in a position of lifetime learning. our training set is what we let our brain feast on.
i think that makes sense. when i get down to write something which is nothing but a form of thinking -
some magical pulses run through my brain unraveling information from my past experiences.
the dots connect and that's how a piece gets written, a thought gets formalised.

but i'm not sure if that is the full equation - is entirety of art a permutated subset of our experiences?
is there anything original at all? is our subconscious our creative god or is it merely a gateway?

in either case, we have a sacred duty towards our subC - we need to take care of it no matter if it is the god or the divine bridge.

> we are what we eat

and that equally applies to our minds as to our bodies.
